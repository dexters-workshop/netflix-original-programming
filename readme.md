### Netflix Programming Project

Data Pipeline (ELT) project using the Modern Data Stack to Extract/Load (Airbyte) netflix data into my data warehouse (Snowflake) then transform/model (dbt) that data before visualizing (tbd) it in a simple dashboard.

**Personal Objective:** expand skills and knowledge w/in the Modern Data Stack (MDS) by setting up an ETL data pipeline that is fully automated and updated with new data daily

**Project Objective:** to build a Dashboard that shows an overview of Netflix historical programs and the ones launching in upcoming days/weeks/months (this way my wife and i can see whatâ€™s coming down the pipeline)

**MDS Tools Used in Project:**
- snowflake (datawarehousing)
- airbyte (data ingestion)
- dbt (data transformation + data modeling)
- prefect (automated orchestration)
- thoughtspot/looker/tableau (data visualization) - TBD

**Link to Dashboard (refreshed daily):** Coming Soon =)
